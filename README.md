# Algorithm_techniques
This project has algorithm techniques to use in the algorithm problems.


## Requirements
1. **Java 11** The best, we use Java 11, but it also works with Java 8 and you can download it from [here!](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11). I recomend to use openJDK.
2. **IntelliJ** This project needs to have installed IntelliJ, you can download the community edition [here!](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), you need to download the Community Edition and follow the [Standalone installation instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html).

## Installation
Clone the project into your local environment and open it from IntelliJ.

## Characteristics
The solutions are organized into packages named after the techniques used to solve them, and they are placed within the 'com.programingsquirrel' basic package. This organization method allows for easy categorization of solutions based on the applied techniques or algorithms, making it convenient to locate specific solutions related to a particular approach.

```java
com.programingsquirrel.threestepreversal
